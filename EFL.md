When panic sets in, Thinking and Intuitive types lose control of their cognitive tools—cognition and intuition. The amygdala activates, triggering anxiety and overriding the DLPFC and ACC, which suppresses working memory and decision-making. Most people attempt to relax and refocus, but J types often panic further as their limited cognitive capacity leads to inaccurate conclusions. Their ability to extrapolate is replaced by basic survival functions, worsening the panic and further shutting down cognition. Fight-or-flight takes over, leading to burnout as mental resources are depleted. Eventually, exhaustion sets in, leading to sleep, which allows the brain to reset. We are all wired to think in specific ways. INTJs and ENTJs have very similar cognitive patterns, except ENTJs rely on routes through the DLPFC and OFC, though not as extensively as INTJs which may use the OFC less, as these routes pass through Broca's area and the motor cortex.

**Amygdala Activation**
The amygdala plays a central role in processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety. When emotions heighten, the amygdala sends strong signals that can override the prefrontal cortex, leading the DLPFC, OFC, and ACC to reduce their activity.

The vmPFC regulates emotions and mediates emotional experiences. In emotionally charged situations, the vmPFC can inhibit the DLPFC and other prefrontal areas.

Emotional abnormalities activate the autonomic nervous system, suppressing cognitive control areas like the DLPFC and ACC. This shift prioritizes emotional and survival responses over detailed cognitive processes.

The temporary agitation causes the anterior insula to relay feelings of emotional discomfort.

The parietal cortex activates to scan for dangers during survival mode.
