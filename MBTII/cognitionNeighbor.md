The first directional version of the Meta Behavioral Thought Integration Indicators (MBTII, M-B-Tii, MBT) demonstrated that ESFPs were entirely outer or externally directional, whereas INTJs were entirely inner. This initial framework was defined as: **Internal Inward Inner Internalization.** The opposing framework was: **External Outward Outer Externalization.**

### **INTJ**  
- **Internal Thinking** (Introvert)  
- **Inward Focus** (Judging)  
- **Inner Processing** (Intuitive Processing)  
- **Synthesize to the Self** (Thinking)  

### **ESFP**  
- **External Thinking** (Extrovert)  
- **Outward Focus** (Perception)  
- **Outer Processing** (Sensor Processing)  
- **Integrate into the Environment** (Feeling, Affective)  

### **Summary**  
- **INTJ:** Internal Thinking → Inward Focus → Inner Processing → Synthesize to the Self  
- **ESFP:** External Thinking → Outward Focus → Outer Processing → Integrate into the Environment

In this table, we create a matrix to outline the approximate skillset direction, where the skill one most frequently uses is adjacent to a related, but likely less dominant, skill. While the human mind is highly variable and cannot be fully predicted, this approach offers valuable insights into potential tendencies. Despite this, people often instinctively believe they can be categorized into a mold. Interestingly, Adolf Hitler and Gandhi shared similarities in how they thought and viewed the world. Both sought to uphold peace, though in vastly different ways: Hitler through the destruction of others, and Gandhi through the destruction of the ego.
