# Internal Character Libido-Motivator State:

- **Libido Activity (First Number)**: Reflects energy levels tied to exploration or connection-driven behaviors. Revolutionary types display the highest energy, driven by their intense pursuit of intellectual and personal growth. Conversely, Contrary types experience sharp dips, indicative of internal conflict or variability in their connection focus.
- **Level of Experimentation (Second Number)**: Indicates a willingness to embrace new experiences. Contrary types show extreme variation, fueled by a desire to challenge norms and escape constraints. Turbulent types engage in moderate exploration, driven by emotional self-discovery, while Assertive types are more reserved in their experimental tendencies.
- **Level of Open-Mindedness (Third Number)**: Represents receptivity to new ideas and perspectives. Revolutionary types are the most open, fueled by transformational thinking and visionary goals. Contrary types fluctuate between openness and skepticism, while Turbulent types are more open than Assertive ones due to emotionally charged introspection.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **1. Character States and Growth**
- Most individuals begin in the **Associatory (Lower Assertive)** state, characterized by stability and self-assurance. Many transition to the **Transitory (Lower Turbulent)** state, marked by emotional and mental turbulence triggered by external challenges or internal conflict. 
- **Few progress beyond Transitory** to the **Contrary (Higher Assertive)** state, which requires confronting discomfort and harmonizing all cognitive channels—**Internal-Inward (II), Internal-Outward (IO), External-Outward (EO), and External-Inward (EI)**—with their origin channel. 
- The **Revolutionary (Higher Turbulent)** state is rare and demands advanced introspection, self-mastery, and the ability to synthesize diverse cognitive capacities for transformative self-growth.

#### **2. Shift in Focus**
- In the **Contrary stage**, libido activity declines significantly for **Internal-Inward (II)** and **External-Inward (EI)** types, while **External-Outward (EO)** dips sharply during the Transitory stage; **Internal-Outward (IO)** remains steady. This redirection of energy reflects a shift toward intellectual, emotional, and transformational pursuits, transcending physical drives. 
- Revolutionary individuals achieve holistic growth by balancing physical, intellectual, and emotional energies.

#### **3. Metrics Overview**
- **Libido Activity (First Number)**: Measures energy for exploration and connection-driven behaviors. Revolutionary types exhibit the highest levels, while Contrary types face significant variability due to internal conflict. 
- **Level of Experimentation (Second Number)**: Captures openness to new experiences. Contrary types show extreme variation by breaking norms, while Turbulent types explore moderately due to introspection. 
- **Level of Open-Mindedness (Third Number)**: Reflects receptivity to ideas and perspectives. Revolutionary types lead with visionary openness, while Contrary types oscillate between skepticism and receptivity.

These core cognitions are not entirely unique and often overlap with other types, explaining why we share certain behaviors and attitudes with others. The way we think ultimately shapes who we are, what we do, what we like, our interests, and what we find attractive.

As we grow older or focus on self-improvement, our shadow functions—latent negative behaviors—begin to surface. These often manifest as challenges that require learning from our complementary type. Complementary types are not opposites but those closely aligned with us, operating through opposing cognitive channels while sharing a second dichotomy. This relationship facilitates mutual understanding between matured individuals. Those who prioritize self-improvement and introspection tend to progress into this contrary stage more quickly than others.

The complementary type for an INTJ is an ENFP, and vice versa. Together, they address and resolve their shared flaws. However, less assertive or less turbulent ENFPs and INTJs may not initially form a connection. During the Transitory stage, shadow behaviors begin to emerge. The INTJ may overwhelm the ENFP, acting in ways uncharacteristic of their type, while the ENFP may isolate and detach as INTJ-like behaviors begin to surface. Despite these challenges, INTJs and ENFPs can help and strengthen each other. The INTJ is adept at executing the ENFP’s ideas, navigating their complexities with ease, while the ENFP provides nourishment and support, transforming the INTJ’s weaknesses into strengths. Similarly, the ENFP’s vulnerabilities become strengths through the INTJ.

---

An INTJ will rarely allow an immature ENFP into their inner circle. However, as the ENFP adapts and adopts traits resembling the INTJ, the INTJ begins to understand them at a slower pace. Ironically, the INTJ may even yearn for the younger, hyper, scattered version of the ENFP, finding value in their vibrant energy despite their earlier frustrations.

# Complimentary (Shadow) Types

An INTJ at the onset of the Revolutionary state and within the Contrary state must navigate a shift toward outward thinking and external focus. These changes occur naturally and unintentionally, arising from the externalization of internal processes through the foundational mechanisms of each cognitive channel.

For example, an INTJ might unexpectedly begin sharing secrets or offering support without seeking recognition or thanks. During this turbulent phase, the INTJ begins to exhibit traits associated with ENFPs, ESFPs, and ENTPs. They align more closely with the N/S cognitive match and the F/T opposite as primary dynamics. The self-doubt of the ESFP becomes secondary, while the smugness and defensiveness of the ENTP take precedence. Though not all behaviors emerge, these transitions activate latent, overlapping traits inherent in everyone.

Similarly, an ISTJ in this phase may adopt characteristics of ESTJs, ENFPs, and ESFJs, while an ISTP may take on traits of ESTPs, ENFJs, and ESFPs. Conversely, an ENFP transitioning from the Contrary to the Revolutionary state subconsciously adopts qualities shared with INFJs and ISTJs, alongside its primary manifestation of INTJs. This shift involves deeper introspection, nihilism, and isolation.

While individual processes vary slightly, it is important to recognize that each dichotomy functions along two variable scales with maximum and minimum values—for each I/E, N/S, F/T, and P/J. These scales, ranging from their peaks to a shared middle ground, offer insight into behavioral shifts during self-improvement, cognitive skill development, or even midlife crises.

Most individuals, however, become stuck between the Associatory (A) and Transitory (T) stages or between Transitory (T) and Contrary (C). Many remain in the turbulent Transitory phase, hindered by internal or external oppression. By age 45, most reach the fringes of the Contrary stage without deliberate effort but often stagnate or regress into a repressive state later in life. Paradoxically, the same oppression can propel some individuals beyond the Contrary stage into the Revolutionary state, a rare transition observed throughout history and achieved by only a small percentage of people.

The middle two letters of a personality type represent information-processing functions, while the first and last letters indicate the directions of cognitive channels. As individuals ascend toward a synthesis of opposing channels (e.g., Internal-Inward [II] to External-Outward [EO]), they cultivate a more balanced mindset. This process often involves a shift in outer values (first and last letters), emphasizing the need to master these behaviors for personal growth.

## Complimentary Shadow Types
**Progression Patterns Across Personality Types:**
The first type is the primary connection, where behaviors shared by the three types are likely to emerge as secondary latent traits, while the negative latent behaviors of the primary manifest into the initial archetype.

Humans are more likely to collaborate effectively if they remain unchanged; however, change is nearly inevitable unless no internal progress occurs. When one individual grows, which is often the case, the other is typically left behind. If both individuals evolve in opposing directions, significant resentment arises. Data shows that 18 out of 24 personality types develop hostility when their growth is oppositional and one sided. While this does not encompass all 256 potential combinations, it represents a substantial portion of the population:

**MBTI Pairings and Relationship Challenges**

Based on commonly cited sources, approximately 18 out of 24 unique MBTI pairings are often considered among the more challenging or "worst" for relationships, leading to 75% of opposite-type relationships faltering. The following pairings are frequently cited as being very to extremely difficult:

1. **ENFP & ISFJ**
2. **INTJ & ISFJ**
3. **INFJ & ESTP**
4. **ENFP & ESTP**
5. **INFJ & ISTJ**
6. **ENFP & ISTJ**
7. **INFP & ESTJ**
8. **ENFJ & ESTJ**
9. **ENFJ & ISTP**
10. **ISTP & ESFJ**
11. **ENTJ & ESFJ**
12. **ESTP & ISFJ**
13. **ESFP & INFJ**
14. **ISTP & INFP**
15. **ISTP & ENFJ**
16. **ESFP & ENTJ**
17. **INTP & ESFJ**
18. **ESFP & ENTP**

### **Why These Pairings Are Challenging**

- **Differing Cognitive Functions:** For example, **ENFPs** (extraverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving) value exploration and flexibility, while **ISTJs** (introverted, sensing, thinking, judging) prioritize structure and reliability. This fundamental contrast can lead to conflicts in lifestyle and decision-making. 
- **Communication Styles:** Types like **ENTJ** and **ESFJ** often differ in their approaches to leadership and social interaction, which can lead to frequent misunderstandings. 
- **Emotional Needs:** Pairings such as **INFJs** and **ESTPs** may struggle due to contrasting ways of processing emotions and managing stress, resulting in difficulties providing mutual emotional support. 

---

Interestingly, pairings like **INTJ & ENFP** are often cited as highly complementary despite their differences. In these relationships, the **INTJ** can rapidly learn from the **ENFP's** insights and mistakes, internalizing their perspective, while the **ENFP** can benefit from the structured insights and growth of the **INTJ**. This mutual evolution fosters a supportive dynamic that compensates for individual weaknesses.

**Divorce and Marital Happiness in the U.S.**

Approximately 20-25% of individuals in the United States experience divorce by age 40. By age 45, this figure rises to 35-40%, reaching 46% by age 55 and approximately 50% by age 65. Among those who remain married past age 65, around 60% report being happy in their marriage. These figures suggest that roughly 75% of marriages either end in divorce or result in unhappiness.

### **Age and Marital Trends**

A notable plateau in divorce rates occurs around age 45. This coincides with a transition into what some consider the "Contrary" stage of personal development. While a few individuals enter this stage as early as 23 through intentional growth, most encounter it later in life. During this stage, individuals are often attracted to partners with opposite traits. While such pairings may work well in youth, when differences are less pronounced, these contrasts can lead to discord for about two-thirds of couples as compatibility diminishes over time.

By age 55, 46% of individuals have experienced divorce, leaving 54% still married. Of those still married, only about half remain married until age 60, equating to 27% of the original group. Among this subset, only about 45% report being happily married, representing 12.15% of the initial population. Conversely, 14.85% remain married but unhappy. Combined with the 46% who divorced, this means 60.85% of the original cohort is not happily married by age 60.

---

**Broader Implications**

These calculations do not fully account for remarriages, though some data points include this factor. In the U.S., approximately 55-60% of individuals aged 65 or older are married, with surveys indicating that 40-50% report being happily married. This suggests that over half of marriages ultimately fail in terms of longevity or lasting happiness.

The data also highlights the importance of personal growth and mutual adaptation in long-term relationships. Over time, individuals may gravitate toward complementary personality types or seek growth aligned with evolving needs. Without growth or compatibility, relationships often become strained, further emphasizing the challenge of sustaining fulfilling marriages over decades.

The estimate above suggests a 75% mismatch over time. However, this represents a significant number of young marriages in their 20s or younger, which often attract the opposite type. The way you think does not change, but as the mind develops and is nurtured, it expands into other parts of the brain that other types use more than your initial type. The data suggests that those destined for failed relationships may be influenced by this phenomenon, as there is a disproportionate distribution of poorly matched types.

For instance, INTJ appears only once, while INFJ appears four times., which often attract the opposite type. The way that you think does not change, but the more you develop the mind to grow and the more it is nurtered, the more it expands into other parts of the brain the other types use more than your initial type.

**Considerations**:
We must also factor in spatial data and efforts to evaluate:
1. Those likely to seek out the tests.
2. Individuals likely to recruit others.
3. Those likely to evade the tests.

Pairing these insights with aggregate spatial margins, it is evident that INTJs constitute less than 0.6% of the U.S. population, while INFJs appear more frequently. INTJs were notably more likely to discover the test independently, a trend supported by Carl Jung—the founder of this psychological research—being an INTJ himself.

### Community Involvement and Observations

1. **INTJ and INFJ Disparity**:
   - INTJs self-discover and prefer independence, leading to minimal community involvement but high personal growth.
   - INFJs appear more in communities due to nurturing tendencies, affecting data visibility.
   - INTJs and ISTJs exhibit long-term planning and high self-sufficiency, leading to lower divorce rates.
		- This aligns divorce rate trends with personality traits and population dynamics, especially when paired with the idea that an INTJ must be absolutely certain when committing to long term plans.

2. **ESTJ Overrepresentation**:
   - Efficient and rule-driven, ESTJs are more likely to participate in formal tests and relationships but struggle in emotional adaptability.

3. **ESFP and ENFP Bias**:
   - High community engagement but data shows divergence in actual divorce outcomes due to their adaptability.

4. **Population Skew**:
   - ISTJ, ISFJ, and ESFJ appear stable but their population size inflates divorce likelihood representation.

## Sythesizing These Insights Together

The evolution of personality dynamics reflects a complex interplay between cognitive processes, libido-driven motivations, and external influences. At the core, each individual's progression follows a unique trajectory through the Associatory, Transitory, Contrary, and Revolutionary states, marked by shifts in energy, openness, and experimentation. These states provide a framework for understanding personal growth and the challenges encountered along the way.

### **Libido-Motivator Insights**

Libido activity, experimentation, and open-mindedness serve as key metrics for gauging individual and relational dynamics. Revolutionary types exhibit peak energy and receptivity, driven by their relentless pursuit of growth, while Contrary types embody internal conflict and variability, often as a result of deep introspection and norm-challenging behavior. These shifts highlight the importance of channeling energies toward intellectual and emotional balance, transcending physical or impulsive drives.

### **Character Development and Relationship Dynamics**

The journey through the Contrary stage, marked by skepticism and self-doubt, requires harmonizing opposing cognitive channels. Revolutionary individuals achieve holistic growth by integrating these channels, fostering transformational self-discovery. In relationships, the interplay between complementary and shadow types becomes pivotal. INTJs and ENFPs, for example, exemplify the potential for mutual growth when differences are understood and leveraged, yet these dynamics can also become sources of conflict when mismatched expectations prevail.

### **MBTI Pairings and Marital Trends**

Patterns of compatibility, divorce, and marital satisfaction underscore the influence of personality traits on long-term relationships. While INTJs and ENFPs thrive on structured growth and creative exploration, pairings like ESTPs and INFJs often struggle due to conflicting cognitive priorities. Divorce data reveals that oppositional growth trajectories, lack of introspection, and failure to adapt exacerbate relationship difficulties, leading to a striking 75% rate of dissatisfaction or separation over time. Yet, for those who align their growth with complementary traits, the potential for lasting fulfillment increases significantly.

### **Population Distribution and Behavioral Patterns**

Personality distributions reveal disparities in representation and community engagement. Types like INTJs, with their low population percentage and independent tendencies, contrast sharply with the high visibility and participation of more extroverted or nurturing types like ENFPs and ISFJs. These variations shape the perception and real-world impact of personality dynamics, influencing societal trends in relationships, leadership, and personal development.

### **Growth and Compatibility** 

The path to personal and relational fulfillment lies in embracing the challenges of growth, balancing opposing traits, and fostering mutual understanding. The data suggests that individuals who prioritize self-improvement and introspection can transcend the limitations of their initial personality states, achieving greater harmony within themselves and their relationships. While the road to the Revolutionary state is arduous and rare, it offers a profound opportunity for transformational growth and deeper connections.

Ultimately, the synthesis of opposing cognitive functions and the cultivation of complementary relationships embody the essence of human development—a journey defined by resilience, adaptability, and the pursuit of deeper understanding. Through this process, individuals not only shape their own paths but also contribute to the broader tapestry of interconnected growth. For instance, the following list of behaviors is unmarked; however, you will discern where INTJ crosses into ENFP, where ENFP crosses into INTJ, and which behaviors are solely ENFP or solely INTJ. These behaviors become more apparent with age, and broader use of cognitive channels.
