In such spaces, according to the triadic framework that differentiates J and P types: Revolutionary (Judging, Conjective) types, who prefer adopting new systems when necessary, often clash with Evolutionary (Perceiving, Perceptive, formally Perjective) types, who favor incorporating new information into existing systems or adapting old information to new frameworks.

Hostility arises when new ideas threaten the more rigid, system-oriented perspectives, such as those in XNTP groups, further highlighting how projecting inferiority stifles openness to new paradigms. Since conditioned inheritance is likely to affect \[P\] types more than \[J\] types, we can understand why they are less disruptive, and more disruptive toward those who are disruptive. \[P\] types advance upward, while \[J\] types advance laterally.

The framework presented challenges the traditional MBTI model, arguing that MBTI's widely adopted approach promotes a profit-oriented perspective that may limit the depth of personality analysis. By framing introversion and extroversion as "Internal Thinking" and "External Thinking," the model shifts from seeing these traits as socially oriented to viewing them as cognitive modes for processing information, specifically contrasting how individuals engage with personal ideas versus external stimuli.

In this model, users align more closely with dominant cognitive behaviors derived from data that wasn’t available when the MBTI was first developed. Individuals display a mix of extroverted traits, such as sociability and action-orientation, and perceiving characteristics like adaptability and spontaneity, guided by cognitive tendencies rather than situational behavior. For example, extroversion indicators reflect comfort in group settings and an external focus, while perceiving indicators highlight flexibility and a preference for variety over rigidity. Test questions within the framework encourage introspection by focusing on responses to unexpected events or knowledge-seeking preferences (e.g., disrupting versus building on established order to find truth), aiming to reveal underlying cognitive patterns instead of relying on self-perceptions of social behavior.

This reconceptualization broadens the view of personality by prioritizing cognitive interests and brain regions associated with specific thinking styles, promoting a more functional and in-depth analysis of personality. This approach categorizes personalities as “Cognitive Genes,” potentially paving the way for more empirical personality research while reducing the biases inherent in traditional self-reporting methods.

Extraversion and introversion cannot be reduced to comfort in crowds. Many individuals engage confidently in public roles, such as theater or public speaking, without necessarily identifying as extroverted. For example, an individual may perform or speak to large audiences, even while experiencing mental anguish or significant stress. Pushing through such discomfort does not inherently correlate with an extroverted disposition, as introverts can also adopt outgoing behaviors. The real distinction lies in cognitive processing—whether an individual focuses internally or externally, which remains challenging to observe from the outside.

Using a precise terminology helps illustrate this point: "internal" refers to introversion, "external" to extraversion, "inward" to Judging, and "outward" to Perception. These combinations clarify how different types approach information and social engagement:

1. **Internal Inward** (Introversion + Judging): These individuals process information privately, emphasizing internal judgment and structure.
2. **Internal Outward** (Introversion + Perception): They process ideas internally but project insights outwardly, often allowing these reflections to impact others.
3. **External Inward** (Extraversion + Judging): These individuals gather external data, then internalize it, focusing on assimilating information from the environment.
4. **External Outward** (Extraversion + Perception): These types engage dynamically with their surroundings, actively responding to environmental cues and feedback.

Historically, figures like Benjamin Franklin exemplify the **External Inward** type, internalizing reflections before implementing change through planning and collaborative efforts. In contrast, an INTJ (Internal Inward) feels the need for change from their experience toward them, then works internally on self-improvement before interacting externally without collaboration. Meanwhile, **Internal Outward** types like INTPs often feel an urgency for change and project ideas outward promptly, seen in the approaches of Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates, and the founders of Google and Wikipedia. Similarly, **External Outward** types, such as ENTPs, see the need for change and externalize it through innovation and politics, exemplified by figures like Thomas Edison and Barack Obama. Each of these orientations impacts not only the individuals' focus and actions but also how they influence their environments.

| Type                  | Cognitive Orientation                             | Behavior Example                                                               | Historical Figures                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Internal Inward** (Introversion + Judging)    | Focuses on structured, private internal processing; reflects deeply and uses data and trial-and-error approaches to refine their ability to take the challenge head-on without the assistance of others. | Processes information thoroughly before implementing structured changes.       | Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Ted Kaczynski, error-correctors, INTJ types        | 
| **Internal Outward** (Introversion + Perception) | Engages in internal reflection that leads to outward impact; introspective yet communicative, aiming to reform within established frameworks, perceiving even small reforms as impactful. | Shares ideas outwardly after internalizing insights, often influencing others with these projections. | Jimmy Wales, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Stephen Hawking, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, IXXP types, authors, philosophers, politicians | 
| **External Inward** (Extraversion + Judging)     | Collects external data and internalizes it to form structured insights, often gathering support from diverse groups to help build on those insights.  | Assimilates external information before making internal decisions.             | Walt Disney, Ben Franklin, Innovator, Visionary, EXXJ types         | 
| **External Outward** (Extraversion + Perception) | Adapts dynamically to environmental feedback; highly responsive across social and external settings, quickly forming solutions and gaining support for pre-existing societal ideas. | Actively engages with surroundings, often driving change through innovation and politics. | Thomas Edison, Barack Obama, Inventor, Promotor, Driver of Change, EXXP types |

*Note*: Elon Musk and Martin Luther require further assessment, as their types are not as clear-cut. I currently lean toward INTP for both, though they remain classified as INTJ for now. Mark Zuckerberg has been reclassified from INTJ to INTP as have many others such as Hilary Clinton, James Cameron, Stephen Hawking, and Patrick Stewart.
