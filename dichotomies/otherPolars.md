# **Polar Socials**

```**Some outdated terminology, as of November 4, 2024, includes using "Introverted" and "Extroverted" thinking instead of the updated terms, "Internal" and "External" thinking; as well as using "Internal" and "External" (thinking or focus) instead of the updated terms, "Inward" and "Outward" auxiliaries.**```

## **Introduction**

The terms *Internal* and *External* represent two fundamental orientations of human cognition and behavior, reflecting how individuals engage with the world around them. These orientations influence the ways people process information, interact with others, and derive energy. Understanding these orientations is essential to grasping the diverse ways individuals perceive and relate to their environments.

While *Internal* and *External* orientations define the source and direction of an individual's energy—whether it's drawn from external interaction or internal reflection—they can be further nuanced by their interplay with the concepts of **Perceptive** and **Conjective** thinking, which represent external and internal focus, respectively. This combination creates a rich tapestry of cognitive styles, as individuals navigate the balance between their inherent orientation (internal or external) and their approach to processing information (Perceptive or Conjective).

In this section, we will explore the characteristics of Internal and External thinking, examine their cognitive focuses, and analyze their behaviors at different maturity levels. By doing so, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these orientations manifest in thought processes and actions, and how they contribute to the diversity of human cognition.

## **Definitions**

### **External Orientation**

**External Orientation** is characterized by an outward focus toward the external world. Externally oriented individuals gain energy from social interactions, active engagement with their surroundings, and direct involvement in external activities. They are often seen as outgoing, sociable, and expressive, thriving in environments that allow for interaction and immediate feedback.

Externally oriented thinkers are stimulated by external input and often process thoughts by articulating them aloud or through interaction with others. They prefer to engage with tangible experiences and are energized by collaborative endeavors. Their focus is on the external environment, and they tend to be action-oriented, seeking opportunities to engage with people and the world around them.

### **Internal Orientation**

**Internal Orientation** is defined by an inward focus toward the internal world. Internally oriented individuals gain energy from solitary activities, deep reflection, and introspection. They are often perceived as reserved, contemplative, and thoughtful, finding fulfillment in exploring ideas and concepts internally.

Internally oriented thinkers process information internally, preferring to reflect deeply before sharing thoughts with others. They are energized by time spent alone or in quiet environments where they can delve into their inner thoughts. Their focus is on internal experiences, and they tend to be reflective, seeking understanding through introspection and internal analysis.

## **Cognitive Foci**

### **Extroverted Thinking**

- **External Engagement**: Extroverted thinkers focus on the external environment, drawing information and inspiration from social interactions, sensory experiences, and direct involvement with the world.
- **Active Processing**: They process information through action and dialogue, often thinking out loud and benefiting from immediate feedback.
- **Concrete Application**: Extroverted thinkers prefer practical applications of ideas, valuing tangible results and observable outcomes.
- **Energy from Interaction**: Social settings and collaborative activities energize them, fueling their cognitive processes through engagement with others.

### **Introverted Thinking**

- **Internal Reflection**: Introverted thinkers focus on their internal world, exploring ideas, concepts, and theories within their minds.
- **Deep Processing**: They process information through reflection and introspection, often requiring solitude to fully develop their thoughts.
- **Abstract Exploration**: Introverted thinkers are comfortable with abstract concepts and enjoy theoretical discussions that may not have immediate practical applications.

# **Polar Senses**

## **Introduction**

The dichotomy of **Intuitive** and **Sensory** represents two fundamental ways individuals perceive and interpret the world around them. This distinction influences how people gather information, focus their attention, and prioritize experiences. Understanding the characteristics of intuitive and Sensory cognition provides valuable insights into the diverse ways individuals interact with their environment and process information.

Intuitive individuals tend to focus on patterns, meanings, and possibilities, often looking beyond the immediate sensory input to interpret underlying concepts and future implications. In contrast, Sensory individuals are grounded in the present, relying on concrete information obtained through their senses, and emphasizing practical application and observable facts.

This section explores the definitions, cognitive focuses, behaviors, and maturity levels associated with intuitive and Sensory thinking. By examining these aspects, we aim to deepen the understanding of how these perceptual orientations shape thought processes, decision-making, and interactions with the world.

## **Definitions**

- **Seek Patterns and Connections**: They enjoy identifying how concepts interrelate.
- **Value Innovation and Imagination**: They are inclined toward creativity and exploring new ideas.
- **Think Abstractly**: They are comfortable with theoretical and symbolic information.

### **Sensory**

## **Integration with Perceptive and Conjective Thinking**

The interplay between intuitive and Sensory orientations with Perceptive (external focus) and Conjective (internal focus) thinking styles further refines individual cognitive profiles:

- **Intuitive Perceptive Thinkers**: Externally focused on possibilities, they seek patterns and meanings in the world around them, often drawing inspiration from interactions and observations to fuel their innovative ideas.
- **Intuitive Conjective Thinkers**: Internally focused on concepts, they explore abstract ideas within their minds, relying on intuition to generate insights and envision future potentials.
- **Sensory Perceptive Thinkers**: Externally focused on concrete details, they engage actively with their environment, gathering sensory information to inform practical actions and decisions.
- **Sensory Conjective Thinkers**: Internally focused on tangible experiences, they reflect on personal experiences and factual knowledge to guide their understanding and approach to tasks.
