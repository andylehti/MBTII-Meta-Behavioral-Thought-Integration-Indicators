The first part: data-collection is the attainment of knowledge within a lifetime of observation and understanding as well as knowledge.

These functions can occur in any order, are not bound by strict structure, and may overlap or restart at any point, emphasizing the iterative nature of the process. In this method, maintaining humility is crucial; otherwise, you risk forming far-fetched ideas, like claiming Hillary Clinton drinks a special liquid to quit aging despite aging precisely as expected.

The order I’ve become familiar with, after thousands of hours of gathering and fragmenting data into a mental model, allows me to extrapolate in many different ways from what has already been achieved, which is the goal. One does not inherently know if they are right or wrong during this thought process—it’s not a conscious effort, much like pattern recognition, which relies more on automatic sensing than conscious awareness of what you're looking for.

This is why IQ tests don’t accurately measure intelligence, especially since a true puzzle lacks a fixed form, strategy, guaranteed solution, or established rules. A genuine test of intelligence involves many modes of thought, with 19 recognized areas of intelligence and more emerging as they are discovered.

A true test wouldn't be fair, which unsettles some because they may interpret "fair" as meaning everything must be exactly the same—an idea they were taught to believe (unintentionally had consequences), but which is inherently not fair.

However, what participants are tested on cannot be uniformly defined or made equal to another’s test, nor should they be punished. Some tests may seem easier to some, and certain aspects of one person’s intelligence may not measure well against another’s.

Thus, intelligence should be evaluated on a complex scale multidimensional curve that only assesses the areas in which individuals excel. Over time, repeated testing would average out to reflect cognitive abilities without comparing students against each other, as that comparison is the underlying flaw of the education system established by the Holy Roman Empire, which contributed to the decline in intellectual capabilities leading to the Dark Ages (a term disliked by Roman Catholic apologists) and has been self-perpetuating through Conditioned Inheritence since.

>While I can model the main thought processes of an INTJ and most of an ENTJ, help will be required in modeling the other types, as it would be inappropriate to assume their cognitive processes.

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering raw information from various sources. This forms the foundation, providing the necessary input for analysis.
   
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring themes, behaviors, or structures within the collected data. It allows for organizing the information into meaningful clusters.
   
3. **Working Memory**: Holding and manipulating information temporarily to compare and connect data. This bridges the gaps between patterns and allows for dynamic interaction between elements.

4. **Synthesis**: Combining multiple data points and patterns into a cohesive whole, forming a more complete understanding of the situation.

5. **Intuitive Thinking**: Leveraging past experiences and subconscious processing to generate ideas or hypotheses, especially in ambiguous situations.

6. **Predictive Profiling**: Using intuitive insights and synthesized data to anticipate future behaviors or outcomes. This step involves extrapolating from current patterns to predict what may happen next.

7. **Source Analysis**: Critically evaluating the reliability and validity of the data sources to ensure that the foundations of predictions are solid.

8. **Critical Thinking**: Applying logical reasoning to challenge assumptions, validate conclusions, and refine the understanding by scrutinizing each step of the process.

9. **Temporal Reasoning**: Understanding the influence of time on the data, how things evolve, and predicting how future timeframes might affect the system.

10. **Qualitative Analysis**: Analyzing non-numerical data such as emotions, opinions, or narratives, which adds depth and context to the patterns identified earlier.

11. **Understanding Perspective**: Taking into account the subjective viewpoints of the individuals or groups involved, enriching the analysis by considering different angles.

12. **Metacognition**: Reflecting on one’s own thought processes and evaluating the effectiveness of the methods used, ensuring that biases or blind spots are mitigated.

13. **Trend Analysis**: Observing long-term patterns or tendencies within the data to forecast future directions, linking closely to predictive profiling.

14. **Inference**: Drawing logical conclusions from the available data, often filling gaps where information may be missing.

15. **Cognitive Bias**: Recognizing and mitigating the influence of personal or systemic biases that might distort interpretations of data.

16. **Systems Thinking**: Viewing the problem or data holistically, understanding how different components interact and influence one another in a broader context.

17. **Assessment**: Evaluating the current understanding, ensuring all aspects of the data, reasoning, and predictions are accounted for, allowing for effective decision-making.

18. **Iterative Refinement**: Revisiting and refining hypotheses, models, or solutions based on new information or feedback, ensuring continuous improvement.

19. **Lateral Thinking**: Applying creative or unconventional approaches to solve problems, encouraging new perspectives and alternative solutions.

20. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporating feedback from previous trials or errors into the next iteration, making adjustments to improve accuracy and understanding.
