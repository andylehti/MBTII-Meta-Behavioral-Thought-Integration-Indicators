# Mindset Progression Framework

## 1. Peripheralist (Mindset -P)

**Peripheralist** individuals represent the initial, immature stage of mindset development. This mindset is characterized by a focus on immediate desires and personal satisfaction, often at the expense of broader considerations.

- **Focused on the Edges**: Pays attention to fringe or less obvious details of a problem.
- **Prone to Impulsivity**: Prioritizes short-term desires without considering long-term consequences.
- **Ego-Centric**: Driven primarily by self-interest, often noticing what others overlook.
- **Conforms When Beneficial**: Acts in ways that maintain personal satisfaction or self-image.
- **Immature in Focus**: Concentrates on immediate gratification rather than broader or future implications.
- **Emotionally Detached**: Prioritizes their own perspective over wider engagement with others.

**Developmental Goal**: Transitioning from the Peripheralist mindset involves recognizing the importance of broader perspectives and the impact of one's actions on others and the future.

## 2. Societal Mindsets: Lateralist (L), Rotationalist (R), and Abstractualist (V)

Upon moving beyond the immature Peripheralist stage, individuals typically adopt one of three societal mindsets: Lateralist, Rotationalist, or Abstractualist. Each of these mindsets offers a distinct approach to understanding and interacting with the world.

### a. Lateralist (Mindset -L)

**Lateralist** individuals are creative and reflective, drawing heavily on past experiences and traditional insights to navigate current challenges.

- **Sentimental and Reflective**: Grounded in past experiences viewed optimistically.
- **Theoretically Inclined**: Prefers historical insights and tradition over future innovations.
- **Empathize with People and Structures**: Values continuity and stability while remaining open to novel connections.
- **Pessimistic About the Future**: Relies on past successes to guide current decisions.

### b. Rotationalist (Mindset -R)

**Rotationalist** individuals are logical and strategic, focusing on future possibilities and maintaining an optimistic outlook toward what lies ahead.

### c. Abstractualist (Mindset -V)

**Abstractualist** individuals focus on the present moment with a detached and stable approach, often conforming to societal norms without deep emotional or intellectual engagement.

1. **Peripheralist (P)**: Begins with a self-focused, immediate gratification approach.
2. **Societal Mindsets (L, R, V)**: Progresses through creative reflection (L), logical future planning (R), or present-focused stability (V).
3. **Integration of Perspectives**: By engaging with and understanding the Lateralist, Rotationalist, and Abstractualist viewpoints, individuals develop the flexibility and empathy required for central integration.
4. **Centralist (C)**: Achieves a well-rounded perspective that integrates diverse cognitive orientations, fostering comprehensive understanding and balanced decision-making.
